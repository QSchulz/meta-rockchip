OpenEmbedded BSP layer for Rockchip boards

About:
-----
	The purpose of this layer is to provide OpenEmbedded BSP support for
	Rockchip-based devices using upstream sources as much as possible.

Dependencies:
------------
	URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
	layers: meta
	branch: matched branches (e.g. master, sumo, ...)

	URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-arm
	layers: meta-arm, meta-arm-toolchain
	branch: matched branches (e.g. master, sumo, ...)

Status of supported boards:
--------------------------
	builds and boots wic image:
		nanopi-m4
		nanopi-m4-2gb
		rock-pi-e
		rock-pi-4a
		rock-pi-4b
		rock-pi-4c
		tinker-board
		tinker-board-s
		vyasa-rk3288
		firefly-rk3288
	builds:
		marsboard-rk3066
		radxarock
		rock2-square

Kernel configuration:
--------------------
When it comes to configuring the kernel, allow the user to choose between:
	1. using the in-kernel defconfig
	2. using an in-layer defconfig + config fragments

The in-kernel defconfig is a very generic configuration meant to build a
kernel that could (theoretically) be run on a wide variety of devices of
the same architecture. I.e. a kernel built for one aarch64 machine (e.g.
the Qualcomm-based DragonBoard 410c) could be used without modification on
a completely different aarch64 machine (e.g. an Amlogic-based Odroid-C4). As
you can imagine, the in-kernel configuration generates a very large kernel.
Currently the in-kernel defconfig produces a kernel that is roughly 12MB.

The in-layer defconfig + config fragments is meant to trim down the kernel
configuration to remove all the hardware settings that aren't relevant to the
specific MACHINE being built. I.e. a kernel built for the rock-pi-4b wouldn't
include, for example, Qualcomm-specific drivers or code.

Currently, option #2 is only available for the following MACHINE(s):
	- rock-pi-4b

The user indicates their intent via the RK_KERNEL_CONFIG_TYPE variable. If
the user does nothing, the default behaviour is to use the in-kernel
defconfig. If the user sets
	RK_KERNEL_CONFIG_TYPE = "inlayer"
then the in-layer defconfig + config fragments will be used.

Maintenance:
-----------
	Please send pull requests, patches, comments, or questions to the
	yocto mailing list (yocto@lists.yoctoproject.org) CCing the maintainer

	When sending patches, please make sure the email subject line includes
	"[meta-rockchip][PATCH]" and follow the community's patch submission
	guidelines, as described in:
		https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Commit_Patch_Message_Guidelines
		https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded

	For example, to send your most recent commit (i.e. just one patch),
	please use something like:
		git format-patch -M --subject-prefix="meta-rockchip][PATCH" HEAD^
		git send-email --to yocto@lists.yoctoproject.org --cc twoerner@gmail.com <your patch file>
